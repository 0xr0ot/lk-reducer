This is a helper program to clean unused files from a project source directory.

== Usage ==
cleanmysourcetree <deletenew/keepnew> [<target directory>]
deletenew will cause new files and directories created during the compilation process to be deleted.
If no target directory is given, it defaults to the current directory.

***WARNING***: As this thing invokes `rm -rf` on directories, you might want to run it
under a different user. In particular if some build process decides to replace an
existing folder with a symlink, things could perhaps get nasty.

This code depends on the uthash library, or whatever you want to call that thing.
