This is a helper program to clean unused files from a project source directory.

Usage:
cleanmysourcetree <deletenew/keepnew> [<target directory>]
deletenew will cause new files and directories created during the compilation process to be deleted.
If no target directory is given, it defaults to the current directory.

***WARNING***: As this thing invokes `rm -rf` on directories, you might want to run it
under a different user. In particular if some build process decides to replace an
existing folder with a symlink, things could perhaps get nasty.

Empty directories will not be removed automatically. If you want to get rid of them, run this in the source tree:

    find . -type d -empty -delete

This code depends on the uthash library, or whatever you want to call that thing.

The idea for this comes from Joshua J. Drake (jduck).
